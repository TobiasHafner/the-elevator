# Elevator Project

This is a programm simulationg an elevator system consisting of a scheduler, an actual elevator to control and user requests for certain floors.

This code can be used to study the efficiency of different scheduling algorithms concering the strategy with wich the requests are answered.

An ascii terminal representation of the elevator and the current state of the system are given.
